## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

I like Youtube, TikTok, and Instagram. Reasons for why I like them is because:
- They allow comments on each post which makes each post more unique than others, even if they are on the same topic.
- They allow users to have photos and videos for feeds.
- They all allow users to livestream and make it accessible with UI elements.

One app that I would like to build is a personal budget tracker app where you can connect multiple accounts and make it easy for users to 
create a budget and see if their spending habits are in line with that budget. I would have a budget page and recent spending be the main page. 

## Notes

The Xcode interface was difficult to navigate and could not find the features needed without searching it up.
